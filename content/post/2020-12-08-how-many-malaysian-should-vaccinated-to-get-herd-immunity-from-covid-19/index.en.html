<p>Recently I have read an <a href="https://codeblue.galencentre.org/2020/11/27/malaysia-buying-pfizers-ultra-cold-covid-19-vaccine-posing-major-distribution-issues/#:~:text=According%20to%20BioSpace%2C%20the%20Covid,price%20sold%20to%20the%20US">article</a> that Malaysian government have made a deal with Pfizer for 6.4 million Malaysian to be vaccinated. So, I am wondering what is the minimal number of people should be vaccinated.</p>
<p>I have also come across this interesting <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/when-will-it-be-over-an-introduction-to-viral-reproduction-numbers-r0-and-re/">article</a> which explains how we can calculate a minimal number of people to be vaccinated to achieved herd immunity based on R naught (R<sub>0</sub>).</p>
<p><strong>R naught (R<sub>0</sub>)</strong></p>
<p>The basic idea of R<sub>0</sub> or basic reproduction number is quite simple. It describes how many secondary infection will derive from the first case. I think Figure 1 below describe this idea very well.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-1"></span>
<img src="r0.png" alt="Basic idea of R~0~(image from https://www.atrainceu.com/content/3-basic-reproduction-number-r-naught)" width="60%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1: Basic idea of R<sub>0</sub>(image from <a href="https://www.atrainceu.com/content/3-basic-reproduction-number-r-naught" class="uri">https://www.atrainceu.com/content/3-basic-reproduction-number-r-naught</a>)
</p>
</div>
<p>So, R<sub>0</sub> can be affected by a few factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>proportion of susceptible people at initial outbreak</li>
<li>infectiousness of the virus or the disease</li>
<li>rate of recovery or death</li>
<li>and a few other factors</li>
</ul>
<p>As R<sub>0</sub> increases more than 1, the spread of the disease will increases, while R<sub>0</sub> below 1 indicates the spread of the disease will decrease and eventually dies out.</p>
<p>However, I noticed that quite a few including KKM (Ministry of Health, Malaysia) have used the term R<sub>0</sub> in their reports instead of R<sub>e</sub> or R<sub>t</sub> which is the effective reproduction number or time-varying reproduction number. R<sub>0</sub> refers to the initial reproduction number at beginning of the outbreak. The “naught” or “zero” in R naught (R<sub>0</sub>) is referring to population condition that has zero immunity to the disease.</p>
<p><strong>Herd immunity</strong></p>
<p>Herd immunity is said to be occurred when a significant proportion of the population is immunized. Subsequently, those whose susceptible (not immunized) will be protected.</p>
<p><strong>How many should be vaccinated</strong></p>
<p>So, back to the initial topic. We can use the formula below to answer this question.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_i &gt; 1 - \frac{1}{R_0}\]</span></p>
<p>P<sub>i</sub> refers to number of proportion that should be immunized or in this case vaccinated.</p>
<p>So, after googling I found one calculation by my lecturer in Biostat Unit, USM, <a href="https://wnarifin.github.io/">Dr Wan Arifin</a> and his colleague. The R<sub>0</sub> based on his <a href="https://wnarifin.github.io/covid-19-malaysia-sir/">calculation</a> is 2.673. Also, I found another <a href="https://codeblue.galencentre.org/2020/04/10/mco-slashed-malaysia-covid-19-infection-rate-by-over-three-times/">article</a> reported that the R<sub>0</sub> is 3.55 in March according to KKM.</p>
<p>Malaysian’s population is estimated at <a href="https://www.dosm.gov.my/v1/index.php?r=column/cthemeByCat&amp;cat=155&amp;bul_id=OVByWjg5YkQ3MWFZRTN5bDJiaEVhZz09&amp;menu_id=L0pheU43NWJwRWVSZklWdzQ4TlhUUT09">32.7 million</a> by the Department of Statistics, Malaysia (DOSM). So, using the formula above, about 63% to 72% of Malaysian population should vaccinated, and this translates to about 20.6 to 23.5 million people.</p>
<p>The deal that Malaysian government made with Pfizer is far from enough, but of course this is a very good and quick decision. We also have other vaccine like Moderna’s vaccine coming up.</p>
