Python is one of the most popular programming language and software. In this post, I will demonstrate how to do a basic data wrangling with Python. This is going to be one of the several series of post related to Python (hopefully). My plan is to cover these topics:

1. Basic data wrangling with Python\
2. Basic plotting with matplotlib and seaborn\
3. Comparison of ggplot in R versus in Python

Once I finish writing any of the topics, I will link it to the above. 

So, let's start.

## Loading necessary packages

Before loading the packages, you need to install the packages. Basically, there are two ways to install the Python packages. Either by pip command or conda command. I will skip this part, but you can refer to [this link to install the packages using pip command](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-packages) or [this link to install the packages using conda command](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/installing-with-conda.html#installing-with-conda). For those who has both R and Python in your machine, I suggest to use a conda command.

Let's load the required packages.
```{python}
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd
from seaborn import load_dataset
```

All the functions from each package can be assessed from the alias or the abbreviated text above. For example, functions in `pandas` package can be accessed through `pd` or to be specific `pd.`. You will see this many times through out this blog post, so do not worry much about this. I am sure you will get the gist of it once you see this later on. In practice, you don't actually need to use `pd` for `pandas` and `np` for `numpy`, but this is a convention or standard practice widely adopted in the Python community.

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
reticulate::py_install('pandas')
reticulate::py_install('seaborn')
```

## Load the data

We going to use [iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris). This dataset is readily available in seaborn package. 
```{python}
iris = load_dataset('iris')
```

Once we load the data, we need to check the variable type. 
```{python}
iris.dtypes
```

Variable species, by right, is a categorical variable. So, we can use `Categorical()` from `pandas` to change it from an object variable type to a category. `pd.` here, means we access the function from `pandas` package as I explained it previously.
```{python}
iris['species'] = pd.Categorical(iris['species'])
```

If we check the variable type again, we can see the species variable is a category.
```{python}
iris.dtypes
```

Next, we can also see the data. Let's see the first 10 rows.
```{python}
iris.head(10)
```

## Slicing and indexing

To see a specific column, we can index as below. Notice, that the row number starts with 0 as opposed to R (if you have used R previously) in which the row number starts with 1.
```{python}
iris['sepal_length'][0:10]
```

Similarly, we can also index as below to get the first 10 rows of sepal_length variable.
```{python}
iris['sepal_length'][:10]
```

Next to access the first 5 rows, we can do as below.
```{python}
iris[0:5]
```

We can also use `iloc()` and `loc()` functions. The main difference between the two functions is that `iloc()` can only accept a numerical value and `loc()` function can accept a string value.
```{python}
iris.iloc[0:2, 0:3] #rows, then columns
iris.loc[0:2, ['sepal_length', 'species']]
```

Subsequently, we can also slice according a logical condition. Below, we slice the petal_length variable that is above the value of 6.
```{python}
ind = iris['petal_length'] > 6
iris['petal_length'][ind]
```

Let's say we want our data to include only setosa species.
```{python}
ind = iris['species'] == 'setosa'
iris.loc[ind, :].head()
```

Once we know about slicing and indexing, we can use this knowledge to change certain values. For example, below we change:

- row 1, 2, 3, and 4 of sepal_length to NA values\
- row 6 of species and sepal_width to NA values
```{python}
iris.loc[0:3, 'sepal_length'] = np.nan 
iris.iloc[5, [1, 4]] = np.nan
```

Let's see the result.
```{python}
iris.head(6)
```

## Missing values

If we want to see if we have any missing values in our data, we can use `isnull()` function.
```{python}
iris.isnull().any().any() #For overall
iris.isnull().any() #Check for each column
```

We can further calculate how many missing values that we have.
```{python}
iris.isnull().sum()
```

## Descriptive statistics

To get a basic descriptive statistics, we can use `describe()` function. Below, we additionally use `round()` to round up the results into one decimal points.
```{python}
iris.describe().round()
```

Notice that the results above only include numerical variables. So, to get the results for categorical variables as well, we need to add `include = all` as below.
```{python}
iris.describe(include = 'all').round()
```

Alternatively, we can also calculate the unique values for the categorical variable. `value_counts()` only calculate the non-missing values.
```{python}
iris['species'].value_counts()
```

Similarly, for numerical variable we can also do manually each statistics. For example to calculate mean, we can use `mean()`. 
```{python}
iris['sepal_width'].mean().round()
```

That's it. These are the basics of handling a dataset in Python. With this knowledge, I hope you feel ready to dive in and explore more on your own.
