I just watched a [youtube video by Andrew Couch](https://youtu.be/qWYgNjnHNWI) about his commonly used function in readr, stringr, and forcats packages. Although, I have used forcats package before, I realised that I have not fully utilised all of its function.

So, in this post, I have summarised main function of forcats that I find useful in my day-to-day R coding. Basically, more like a note to myself.

## Main functions

We will use [mtcars data](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/mtcars) to demonstrate each function. forcats is part of tiyverse packages. So, it will loaded, once we loaaded tidyverse packages.

```{r load library, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(mtcars)
```

There are 9 forcats functions that I think very useful.

1.  `factor()`

`factor()` changes variable type into a factor or categorical type

```{r}
mtcars$carb <- factor(mtcars$carb)
glimpse(mtcars)
```

2.  `fct_inorder()`

This function sorts factor levels based on the order of appearance in the dataset.

```{r}
levels(mtcars$carb) # original levels
fct_inorder(mtcars$carb) # levels based on the order of appearance
```

3.  `fct_infreq()`

This function sorts factor levels based on the frequency of values.

```{r}
fct_count(mtcars$carb) # this is forcats function as well, count factor level
levels(mtcars$carb) # original levels
fct_infreq(mtcars$carb) # levels based on the frequency values
```

4.  `fct_relevel()`

This function can be used to change the order manually.

```{r}
levels(mtcars$carb) # original levels
fct_relevel(mtcars$carb, c("8", "6", "4", "3", "2", "1")) # manually changed new levels
```

`fct_relevel()` can also be used to change one factor level only.

```{r}
levels(mtcars$carb) # original levels
fct_relevel(mtcars$carb, "8", after = 2) # change level 8 to the third place
```

5.  `fct_reorder()`

This function changes the order based on another variable. Let's change variable carb's levels based on value of variable disp.

```{r}
levels(mtcars$carb) # original levels
fct_reorder(mtcars$carb, mtcars$disp, .fun = sum, .desc = TRUE) # new level based on disp value
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(carb) %>% 
  summarise(sum_disp = sum(disp)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(sum_disp)) # this is basically what we do with fct_reorder() above
```

Additionally, `fct_reorder()` can be used with plotting as well.

```{r}
# Original plot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = carb, y = disp)) +
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
# Plot with changed levels
mtcars %>% 
  mutate(carb = fct_reorder(carb, disp, .fun = sum, .desc = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = carb, y = disp)) +
  geom_col()
```

6.  `fct_lump()`

This function lumps factor levels into other factors. There are 5 variants of this function:

- `fct_lump()`
- `fct_lump_min()`
- `fct_lump_n()`
- `fct_lump_lowfreq()`

The remaining one variant is `fct_lump_prop()`. It is not in the example below as I do not find it useful at least for my current R coding routine.

`fct_lump()` automatically lump small frequency factor group into one group.

```{r}
fct_count(mtcars$carb) # this is forcats function as well, count factor level
fct_lump(mtcars$carb) %>% fct_count() 
```

`fct_lump_min()` lump factor group into one group based on the given value.

```{r}
table(fct_lump_min(mtcars$carb, min = 2)) # group 6 and 8 lump into one group
```

`fct_lump_n()` lump all level except for the *n* most frequent factor groups.

```{r}
table(fct_lump_n(mtcars$carb, n = 2)) # 2 frequent group only, others in one group
```

`fct_lump_lowfreq()` lump small frequent groups into one group, while making sure that particular one group is still the smallest.

```{r}
table(fct_lump_lowfreq(mtcars$carb, other_level = "low")) # group low is still the smallest
```

7.  `fct_other()`

`fct_other()` is much like `fct_lump()`, except we manually choose which factor groups to be combined.

```{r}
table(fct_other(mtcars$carb, keep = c("8", "6"))) 
```

8.  `fct_recode()`

This function is used to rename or relabel the factor group.

```{r}
table(fct_recode(mtcars$carb, hanis = "8")) 
```

9.  `fct_relabel()`

`fct_relabel()` is extremely useful if we want to rename quite a number of factor groups.

```{r}
table(mtcars$carb) # original groups
table(fct_relabel(mtcars$carb, ~ c("abu", "ali", "chong", "siti", "krish", "lee"))) # new named groups

```
