summary: This workshop was organised by Unit Biomedikal Epidemiologi, Pusat Sumber Khas (SRC), Institut Penyelidikan Perubatan (IMR).
abstract: This workshop introduced participants to the fundamental concepts of machine learning and deep learning, covering key algorithms and their applications. Participants were also guided through practical exercises using R, with a focus on data manipulation, visualization, and implementing basic machine learning models. By the end of the workshop, attendees were equipped with the skills to utilize R for analyzing datasets, building predictive models, and applying deep learning techniques, fostering a deeper understanding of how machine learning and R can be used in real-world problem-solving.
