**From a medical graduate to a quantitative researcher**

I am a PhD student in the field of public health epidemiology in [Universiti Sains Malaysia](https://www.usm.my/). In my PhD study, I explored the potential application of machine learning and deep learning in the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer. I have submitted my thesis draft to the university and currently, I am waiting for my Viva-voce examination.

I did my degree in medicine. However, I believed that working as a doctor in a clinical setting is not for me. Thus, I continued my master study in [medical statistics](http://www.medic.usm.my/biostat/en/79-main). Data and analysis has sparked my interest since then. I believes that coming from medical background, give me an edge to see data in a new perspective.

As of now, I am working with [Jom Research](https://jomresearch.netlify.app/) to provides easily accessible webinars centered around research and statistical analysis at a reasonable price point. Do check out our [future webinars](https://jomresearch.netlify.app/webinars/)!
