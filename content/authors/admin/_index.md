**From medical graduate to data enthusiast**

I am a PhD student in the field of public health epidemiology in [Universiti Sains Malaysia](https://www.usm.my/) under the supervision of one of the well-established medical epidemiologist and biostatistician in Malaysia, [Assoc Prof Kamarul Imran Musa](https://myanalytics.com.my/).

I did my degree in medicine. However, I believed that working as a doctor in a clinical setting is not for me. Thus, I continued my study in [medical statistics](http://www.medic.usm.my/biostat/en/79-main). Data and analysis has sparked my interest since then. I believes that coming from medical background, give me an edge to see data in a new perspective.
