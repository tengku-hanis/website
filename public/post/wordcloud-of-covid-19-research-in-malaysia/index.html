<p>Let’s see how much research has been done in term of COVID-19 in Malaysia. In this analysis, we are going to use <a href="https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri?display=basic&amp;zone=header&amp;origin=#basic">Scopus database</a> to access the relevant research or papers. In this analysis we are going to use 4 specific parts of the scientific paper:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Title</li>
<li>Abstract</li>
<li>Author’s keywords</li>
<li>Scopus’s keywords</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/sample%20paper.png" alt="Sample of paper" />
Above is a sample of paper that shows the section of scientific paper that we are going to use in our analysis. The Scopus’s keywords are generated by the Scopus database, thus, it does not available on the paper.</p>
<p>So, the analysis will be applied separately on these 4 parts of the papers. Also, we are going to use map (equivalent to loop) since the flow of the analysis is similar.</p>
<p>Load the related packages. The main package is <code>quanteda</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(quanteda)
library(quanteda.textstats)
library(quanteda.textplots)
library(patchwork)
library(wordcloud2)</code></pre>
<p>I have uploaded the data that I downloaded from the Scopus database into my GitHub.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Read data from GitHub repo
df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tengku-hanis/scopus-data/main/covid-malaysia.csv&quot;) %&gt;% 
  janitor::clean_names() %&gt;% 
  rename(title =i_title)</code></pre>
<p>First, we need to tokenize the sentence. In other words, we break down the sentences into words.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Tokenize
tok_list &lt;- 
  df %&gt;% 
  select(title, abstract, author_keywords, index_keywords) %&gt;% 
  map(tokens, 
      remove_punct = T, 
      remove_numbers = T,               
      remove_symbols = T)</code></pre>
<p>Next, we remove words that are not meaningful such ‘a’, ‘the’, etc. These words are known as stop words.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Remove stop words
nostop_toks &lt;- 
  tok_list %&gt;% 
  map(tokens_select, 
      c(tidytext::stop_words$word, stopwords(&quot;en&quot;)), 
      selection = &quot;remove&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then, we create a document feature matrix (DFM). Basically DFM is a matrix that represent the frequency of each word (feature) in each document (in our case, paper or manuscript). Another name for DFM is document term matrix (DTM). <code>quanteda</code> uses the term DFM, some other packages use the term DTM.</p>
<p>Additionally, we also apply term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) metrics. In scientific papers, the words such as ‘determine’, ‘conclusion’, ‘introduction’, etc are very frequent, and these words are not meaningful as well. Instead of removing manually one by one, we use TF-IDF. So, TF-IDF basically remove the words that are too common, thus we get only the relevant or important words.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create DFM and apply tf_idf
covid_dfm_list &lt;- 
  nostop_toks %&gt;% 
  map(dfm) %&gt;% 
  map(dfm_tfidf)</code></pre>
Once, we have our words (tokens), we can create a plot of most relevant terms based on TF-IDF.

<p>Finally, we can make our wordcloud, but we need to convert our DFM to data frame first. Also, we are going to round the value of TF-IDF and limit to top 1000 terms only.</p>

<p>Actually, <code>quanteda</code> itself is able to produce a wordcloud. However, the wordcloud from <code>wordcloud2</code> is more interactive and we can see the value of TF-IDF if we click the words.</p>
